<H1> About me</H1>
<p>My name is Grace destiny</p>
<P> This includes doing spoken word<p>
<p> The love of christ  </p>
<H2> I WILL SURVIVE THIS JUST LIKE I ALWAYS HAVE BEFORE</H2>
<P>With trembling hands, tired eyes and a heart thats know both ache and hope.Because God has never fail me, not once And even when i thought i wouldnt make it, somehow i did.
    not by my own strength,but by grace that held me quitely.By peace that passed  understanding.By a God whos never left.</H2>
    <H2> A WORLD WE CREATED</H2>
<P> We built this world with bare hands and broken dreams,
stiched together by whispers and silent screams.
Brick by brick, we laid our fate,
some in laughter, some in hate.

 We watched love rise, then crumble fast, traded hearts like currency that never lasts. They told us power was measured in weight, but we saw it shattered in the hands of fate.

Sons forget to kneel before their queens,
mothers carried burdens unseen.
streets swallowed youth, drained their fight,
while leaders  pledged under dimming light.</P>
